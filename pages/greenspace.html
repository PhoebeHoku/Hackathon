    <h1>Access to green spaces: </h1>
    <p>Veganism often goes hand-in-hand with a love for nature and animals. Neighborhoods with parks, nature reserves, or hiking trails may be more attractive to vegans.</p></div>

<div class="Page">
    <h1>Lorem ipsum green space</h1>
    <p>Mountains are so simple, they're hard. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Isn't that
        fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Fluff that up.</p></div>

    <h1>Lorem ipsum clouds</h1>
    <p>Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your
        heart. This is your world. Be brave. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the
        framework first. We don't have anything but happy trees here.

    <h1>Lorem ipsum trees</h1>
    <p>A big strong tree needs big strong roots. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your
        challenge for the day. We don't have anything but happy trees here. We spend so much of our life looking - but
        never seeing.

    <h1>Lorem, ipsum limbs for fruit</h1>
    <p>Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Don't be bashful drop me
        a line. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Let's get wild today. It takes dark in order to show
        light.</p>
